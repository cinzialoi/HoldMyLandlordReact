# HoldMyLandlord

# Hold my landlord by Cinzia - She Codes crowdfunding project - React frontend. 

## About: Hold my landlord is a crowdfund website where ungrateful tenants can support landlords across Australia to help them pay for maintenance bills, taxes, a new jet-ski, anything really! With the seemingly ever increasing interest rates, our landlords, home providers and guardian angels are the ones doing it the toughest. It’s time to give give something back. On top of your rent. That you pay regularly and on time. And is above market. Don’t forget to tip!

## Features: 
*Money, please (AKA projects): With Money Please landlords are able to post requests for money for a specific cause.
*Supporters cannot post anonymously to maximize guilt and shame pheasants into higher donations.

### Stretch Goals 
*Know your landlord: Landlords will have their own dedicated profiles, where you’ll find their bio with their story on how they became involved in this selfless business, info on how many properties they own, their total asset value, as well as how much rent each property returns. 
*Random tip of kindness: go on, you know you want to feel better about lowering their property values by living in them. Give a random tip to a random landlord using our spinning wheel of tips.
